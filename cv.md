## About myself:

 In **2007** i *graduated from the University. A.A. Kuleshova*. *I worked* for five years in my specialty *in the education department of the Mogilev region*. I developed the design of the first website of the education department. The markup was done with the help of PotoShop and such a mother. All the shortcomings and inaccuracies of the markup were solved by graphics, but not HTML. At that moment, I first felt the need to study HTML. The job site continued for several years after I was fired.

In **2012**, *I started working for the Mobile TeleSystems company*. Working in a dynamic, rapidly developing company, you need to know modern technologies (how they work). My job responsibilities are directly related to knowledge of the specifics of the smartphone market. In **2016**, he attended courses at the BRU, unfortunately, for a number of reasons, he could not complete them. Since **2018** I have been holding a management position in the company. I am responsible for the work of three sales outlets in the Oktyabrsky district of the city of Mogilev. For the high-quality performance of official duties, collecting statistics, planning work, I deeply studied the *Microsoft Office package, 1C*.

In **2021**, I started my studies at the RS school. What opportunities will open up for me after graduation, we will see pretty soon ... but the fact that time will not be wasted is for sure!

In **2016**, i took part in a social project *to teach people of retirement age computer literacy "All ages are submissive to the network."
